# Notes
## Ghosts
### Spirit
- In general doesn't have any abilities
- Smudging will last for 180 seconds (3 minutes) instead of 90 seconds (1.5 minutes)

### Wraith
- Can walk through walls
- Might spawn outside of ghost room during hunt?
- Can see through doors when hunting
- Doesn't leave salt footprints (footsteps can still be heard)
- Becomes more active (and likely to hunt?) after stepping in salt
- Ability: In wander phase, can teleport to a player and create EMF 2 at that player's location.

### Phantom
- Disappears when photo is taken
- Apparently can look like another player when showing itself
- Showing itself drains sanity more than usual
- Is related to the Ouija Board canonically, maybe not gameplay-wise though
- Ability: Creates EMF 2 and walks to a random player. Will enter idle phase upon reaching its destination.

### Poltergeist
- Will often interact with objects in the room, throwing and using them frequently
- Ability: Will throw _all_ throwable objects nearby and create EMF 3 for each. If a player witnesses this, their sanity will decrease by 2x the amount of props that were thrown.

### Banshee
- Focuses on/follows one player in particular
- If the target leaves the dies, a new target will be chosen
- A banshee's chosen target will be the highest player on the player list who is currently alive
- Crucifixes have higher radii when dealing with a Banshee (they _might_ also decrease Banshee activity)
- Ability: Will move to target's position and wait 20 seconds. If Banshee doesn't see its target during or after navigation, it will start a hunt (only happens if target is inside)

### Jinn
- Will be more active/likely to hunt when someone is nearby
- Likes to interact with electronics (phones, light switches, etc.)
- Will move faster during hunts if target is further away
- Turning off the breaker disables its hunting ability and makes ghost orbs more frequent, so Jinn will not often disable it itself
- Being near a Jinn has a chance to decrease sanity substanitally
- Ability: If fusebox is on, all players' sanity will be decreased by 25% and EMF2 will be left at its location

### Mare
- Higher activity/more likely to hunt when lights in its room are off
- Will often turn off the lights or turn off the fuse box to give itself this bonus
- Will almost never turnlights back on
- Lights only weaken hunting and activity, not disable them

### Revenant
- During hunts, will move slowly when victims are not in sight but will move incredibly quickly if it sees one
- Will easily switch targets during hunts
- Attacks relatively often

### Shade
- Less active/likely to hunt when more players are nearby
- Very active when only one person is nearby
- Targets alone players during hunts

### Demon
- Incredibly aggressive, hunts more than any other ghost
- Successful Ouija Board questions will not lower sanity

### Yurei
- Will drain sanity passively more quickly (refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19iOQk96zRQrrXBNluIKrfDKpwikW0zppe1fygvN-Rts/edit#gid=0))
- Smudge sticks prevent the Yurei from entering wander phase

### Oni
- More active/likely to hunt when more players are nearby
- Very inactive when only one person is nearby
- Throws items with high velocities
